Hey. My name is Izora Quinn.
I'm working on a project to build a working School management system(SMS).
I'm a software engineer aspirant and I'll follow the SDLC to make the project a reality

The SDLC has 7 phases which are...
-> Ideation
-> Requirements
-> Design
-> Implementation/ Development
-> Testing
-> Deployment
-> Maintenance

The repository will contain text files highlighting my progress. Once the design is completed, then i can reach out
to my peers to help me 
I'll also be needing the sufficient standards to ensure the software quality
